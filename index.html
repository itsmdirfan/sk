                Eighth seed James Duckworth will square off against Jason Kubler in the quarterfinals of the Hall of Fame Open on Friday.<br>

                James Duckworth has been plagued with injuries throughout his career. He sustained a hip injury at the Australian Open, which kept him out of action for three months before undergoing his ninth surgery and making a comeback at the Lyon Open in May.<br>

                Since then, the Australian has won seven out of 15 matches, with a semifinal appearance at the Porto Challenger being his stand-out performance. He made early exits from the Eastbourne International and Wimbledon Championships but has secured a place in the last eight of the Hall of Fame Open with remarkable wins over Liam Broady and Quentin Halys.<br>

                Duckworth outlasted the big-serving Halys to win 7-5, 3-6, 6-2.<br>
                Jason Kubler, on the other hand, has been quite impressive this season, winning 40 out of 51 matches and capturing back-to-back M25 Canberra titles in March. He also triumphed at the Little Rock Open in May, winning his seventh ATP Challenger tour title.<br>

                The Australian entered Newport on the back of an eye-catching performance at Wimbledon, making the Round of 16 of the grass-court Major before losing out to World No. 13 Taylor Fritz.<br>

                He continued his rich vein of form at the Hall of Fame Open, breezing past Jordan Thompson in the first round and outclassing top seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second, coming back from a set down to win 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(4). Kubler has reached the quarterfinals of an ATP main tour event for the first time in his career.<br>
